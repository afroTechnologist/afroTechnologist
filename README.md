## Hi there, I'm Helen ðŸ‘‹

A DevSecOps-specialist with experience in cybersecurity, cloud technologies, and automation. Iâ€™ve gained practical knowledge through courses in Microsoft Azure, cloud security, container technology, CI/CD, network management, and object-oriented programming (C#). This has helped me build a strong foundation in developing and secure digital solutions.

Iâ€™ve worked in both Windows and Linux environments, focusing on network security, and I understand how to integrate security throughout the development process. By combining these technical skills with agile methodologies and requirements management, Iâ€™m ready to contribute to fast, secure software deliveries.
